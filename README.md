# Spell Game(3D educational demonstration by unity)
## Tech Stack: Unity 3D, C#, Android platform
HIGHLIGHTS:
-	Different difficulty: As the difficulty(level) increases, the number of words that need to be learned and the score of passing test increase, less time to answer quiz
-	Different platforms: use the joystick to control the movement of characters on the Android platform, and use the keyboard to control the PC platform
-	Physics: Judging whether to collide based on the distance between objects, instead of using the collision system from the game engine
-	Education: Step-by-step learning. For example, for the same food, you only need to fill one letter when you meet it for the first time, and you need to fill two letters for the second time, increasingly
-	AI: a NPC follows the player. Different animations are played when the player learns new words or fails, and there is text feedback on the screen
-	Expansion: The game has resource data configuration. If you want to add, delete or modify the words you learn, you can quickly modify them
